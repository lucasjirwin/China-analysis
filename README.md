# China-analysis
Analyzing World Bank and human development data for China to assess its recent social and economic policies. This project is concerned with investigating China's current domestic situation since 2012. 

The first analysis tests the hypothesis that inequality in China has decreased since President Xi Jinping embarked on an aggressive anti-corruption domestic campaign in 2012. Using data obtained from the World Bank and slicing out rows pertaining to the Gini coefficient - a widely used measure of inequality - it plots inequality from 1990-2016 and conducts a two-sided t-test to assess whether the difference in the Gini coefficient between 2001-2012 and 2012-2016 is significant. The period 2001-2012 is chosen since it marks the point at which China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) and thus began to see two-digit growth which exacerbated inequality. The period 2012-2016 is chosen because it marks the point at which Xi Jinping vowed to put an end to corruption and reduce inequality. The result is a statistically significant difference in the Gini coefficent between the two periods (at the 95% level) which supports the hypothesis.
